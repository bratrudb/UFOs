# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a table that is populated with data on UFO sightings that can be sorted based on date, state, country, and UFO shape using JavaScript.

## Results
Data on this webpage can be sorted using based on five criteria: Date, City, State, Country, or UFO shape. The table automatically updates with the criteria entered into any of the filter options. This can be seen in the images below.

## Summary
One drawback of this table design is you have to know exactly what you are searching for in order to filter the table. This adds difficulty in sorting the table.

Two recommendations for further development include:
  - Adding a feature to sort the table based on the headers to add more flexibility. An example may be having the capability to sort the cities alphabetically.
  - Another feature would be to include an option to sort based on a range such as a range of dates.
